metaDescription: Examples of using New Relic's NerdGraph API to view, create, and rename saved views.
---

You can use [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) to view, create, update and delete your private or shared saved views.

It will help to have a basic understanding of [General NerdGraph requirements](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#authentication) as well as field definitions in [NerdGraph explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#explorer).

## Saved views read

The `viewSearch` is used to retrieve saved views by applying a set of query filters. It can take `cursor`, `filter`, `limit` and `orderBy`.

**viewSearch**:
* `filter`: The filter field allows the below parameters to be passed in to filter results.
  * `capabilities`: The filter field `capabilities` is an optional array of strings that filters by the text and returns the capability to which the saved views belongs. For example, if you provide `infrastructure.hosts`, the saved views returned will be filtered to saved views that belong to the "infrastructure.hosts" page. 
  * `accounts`: The filter field `accounts` takes in an array of one or many account IDs by which to filter saved views.
  * `filterFavorites`: The filter field `filterFavorites` will filter by favorited saved views (true) or not favorited saved views (false).
  * `ids`: The filter field `ids` will filter based on an array of provided Saved View IDs.
  * `owners`: The filter field `owners` takes in an array of New Relic user IDs. This will return all saved views created by those users.
  * `searchText`: The filter field `searchText` takes in a string and allows saved views that contain the provided text string in the query or in the name.
* `orderBy`
  * `sortBy`: The order by field `sortBy` takes in one enum of `ASC` or `DESC`.
  * `field`: The order by field `field` takes in one enum of `CREATED`, `NAME`, or `QUERY`. `CREATED` will sort based on the creation date. `NAME` will sort the list based on the view name. `QUERY` will sort the list based on the query parameters.
* `cursor`: String used to fetch the following page if it exists. Note that when this is not null, order and limit will be ignored.
* `limit`: Allows you to restrict the number of Saved View results returned.

**results**: Results is where the options returned from the search query are picked.
  * `name`: The `name` field is a optional string allowing the filtering of saved views by name string. 
  * `id`: The `id` is a field referring to the identifier of a specifc Saved View.
  * `account`: The `account` field is referring to the account of the Saved View.
  * `capability`: The `capability` field returns the capability the Saved View is scoped to.
  * `context`: The `context` field only has one option: `additionalData` to get return data on metadata of the Saved View.
    * `additionalData`: The `context` object with the `additionalData` field is the query context including metadata about a given saved view. Additional data is unstructured arbitrary data associated with the Saved View. One example for addtional data is platform level filters like time or user preferences associated with the Saved View.
    * `favoriteCount`: The `favoriteCount` will return how many times the Saved View has been favorited.
  * `visibility`: The  `visibility` field is a required enum consisting of either `SHARED` or `PRIVATE`. This determines whether the Saved View is available to just you (`PRIVATE`) or is available account wide (`SHARED`).
  * `createdAt`: The `createdAt` field will return the date time of the saved views creation.
  * `createdByUser`: The `createdByUser` field will retrieve various data of the user that created the Saved View. Options are `email`, `id`, `name`, and `gravatar`. If the Saved View is `PRIVATE`, the user will be you. If it is a `SHARED` view, the user will be the person who created the Saved View.
  * `favorite`: The `favorite` field will retrieve the boolean value of whether the Saved View is favorited.
  * `filter`: The `filter` field returns the filter being used within the Saved View.
  * `permissions`: The `permissions` field returns who has permissions on the Saved View.
  * `viewType`: The `viewType` field returns how the Saved View should be displayed: table or tiles.
  * `updatedAt`: The `updatedAt` field returns the time date of the last time the Saved View was updated.

  actor {
    savedViews {
      viewSearch(
        filter: {capabilities: "infrastructure.hosts"}, 
        limit: 30, 
        orderBy: {direction: DESC, field: CREATED}
      ) {
        results {
          capability

  * `favorite`: The boolean indicating whether this is a favorite view or not.
  * `filter`: Define the saved view filter to be persisted e.g. A common query for Entity Explorer.
  * `name`: Create a name for the Saved View. 
  * `viewType`: _Optional_ Should the Saved View be displayed as a table or a tile.
  * `visibility`: Define whether the Saved View should be `PRIVATE` or `SHARED` with all users in the account. If `visibility` is not defined and `ACCOUNT` is provided, it defaults to `SHARED`.
  * `failures`: _Optional_ Define whether you would like failures details to be returned if they happen.
    * `message`: Message contains the specific failure.
    * `type`: Type contains the failure type.
