Telemetry data, or data that's collected from one source and reported to a monitor for analysis, is becoming increasingly used in modern organizations with multiple data sources to collect. But navigating and managing that data comes with its own considerations, and optimizing how you deal with your telemetry data can save you time and money. This is especially true for complex organizations that have numerous business units and working groups. 

This is where **Data ingest governance**, or the practice of ensuring optimal value for the telemetry data your organization has collected, comes in. Our guide will help you prepare for and carry out the best practices for using this concept within your oganization. After completing this tutorial series, you'll:

* Reduce redundant or unnecessary telemetry data, saving you time and money.
* Understand exactly which groups within the organization are contributing which data. 
* Expose where your telemetry data is coming from and reduce data management silos.
* Account for ingest costs in a clear and concise way.
* Adjust your ingest volume with full context of the observability value of the data.

## Before you begin [#before-begin]

You'll need to make sure that you have data managed with New Relic so that you can use **data ingest governance** to optimize it. See our [data management doc](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-your-data/) if you need more information.

You'll also need to ensure that you or your team have the ability to track and manage:

* Working with a manager to stay within monthly ingest targets, if applicable.
* Monitoring data ingest baselines and respond to anomalies.
* Drafting and approving plans for data optimization/reduction as needed.
* Participating in scheduled check-ins for analyzing baseline data and comparing it to ingest targets.
* Making modifications to ingest targets as needed.

If you don't already, you should consider having an observability center of excellence team (or something similiar) which is responisble for:

* Maintaining the relationship with New Relic.
* Governing accounts and users.
* Onboarding new teams and individuals.
* Maintaining an observability knowledge base.
* Promoting collaboration and sharing among teams.

Having a team like this can be instrumental in helping you achieve high quality observabilty for your entire organization.
