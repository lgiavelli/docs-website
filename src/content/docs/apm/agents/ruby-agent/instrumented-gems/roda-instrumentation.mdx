## Getting started

To set up your Roda app with New Relic:

1. Add the `newrelic_rpm` gem to Gemfile and bundle.
   ```
   gem 'newrelic_rpm'
   ```
2. In your Roda app, below the Roda **require** directive, add `require 'newrelic_rpm'`. For example:

  ```
  require 'roda'
  require 'newrelic_rpm'

  class App < Roda
    route do |r|
      r.root do
        "Hello World!"
      end
    end
  end
  ```

## Rack instrumentation

As a Rack-based framework, Roda instrumentation requires Rack instrumentation to work properly. Rack instrumentation is enabled by default.
